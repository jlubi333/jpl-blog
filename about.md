I love computer science, math, playing the piano, fencing, and crochet. Most of
all though, I am passionate about education: not just learning great things for
myself, but also teaching and sharing what I know with others.

I aspire to be a professor of computer science so that I will be able to combine
two of my strongest passions: theoretical computer science and teaching---I am
just as motivated and inspired by teaching others as I am by being on the
cutting edge of research.

I just hope that one day I will be able to pay off the debt of gratitude that I
have to all the wonderful people who have taught me in my life by passing on the
knowledge that they have imparted to me to the next generation.

Some quick facts about me:

- I've loved programming ever since I was in seventh grade. My
  favorite programming languages are Haskell, Python, and C; Haskell for its
  beauty, Python for its convenience, and C for its speed.
- My favorite classical music composers are Frédéric Chopin, Ludwig van 
  Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Sergei
  Rachmaninoff.  My favorite piece is Beethoven's [Piano Sonata No. 32 in C
  Minor, Op.  111][sonata].
- I currently fence sabre, but in the past I have fenced épée. I really like
  both.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my blog!
