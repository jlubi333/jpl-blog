<h1>Hi there, I&rsquo;m Justin Philip Lubin.</h1>
<p>I love computer science, math, playing the piano, fencing, and crochet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loved programming ever since I was in seventh grade. My favorite programming languages are Haskell, Python, and C. I hope to one day be a professor of computer science so I can research what I love and teach new students about the world of computer science!</p>
<p>My favorite composers are Frédéric Chopin, Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. I also occasionally get into a Debussy and Satie mood wherein I become obsessed with them.</p>
<p>I currently fence sabre, but in the past I have fenced épée. I really like both.</p>
<p>If you like what I write <span class="mutter">(for some weird reason...)</span>, then you should check out my <a href="http://jlub.in">portfolio</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/jlubi333/">Github account</a>.</p>
