<h2>Hi there, I&rsquo;m Justin Lubin.</h2>
<p>I love computer science, math, playing the piano, and fencing. I&rsquo;ve loved programming ever since I was in sixth grade. My favorite programming languages are Haskell, Python, C, and Java.</p>
<p>My favorite composers are Frédéric Chopin, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Sergei Rachmaninoff.</p>
